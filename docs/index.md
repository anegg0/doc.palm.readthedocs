# Palm

## What's Palm?

The Palm network is an Ethereum sidechain dedicated to selling, purchasing, and trading NFTs that
are associated with real-world and digital assets.

The Palm network uses IBFT 2.0 proof of authority (PoA) consensus, with network validators being run
by key stakeholders. IBFT 2.0 is over 99% more energy efficient than proof of work (PoW) networks.
The initial group of validators for the Palm network will expand over time as additional validators
are added, further increasing the resilience of the network.

An automated bridge relay service connects payment tokens, like DAI, and NFTs on Ethereum and the
Palm network, with bridging contracts deployed on both networks to manage the connection.
Fees collected from this bridge are partially used to purchase carbon offsets.

## Why develop on Palm?

Powered by the PALM token, the Palm Network ecosystem enables creators and artists to mint
energy-efficient NFTs with low gas fees and fast transaction finality.

Palm is a fully Ethereum-compatible network, allowing you to deploy any EVM-compatible smart
contracts and use standard, familiar Ethereum tools during application development.
See [the list of supported tools](Reference/Tools.md).

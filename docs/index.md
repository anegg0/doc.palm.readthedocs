# Palm

Palm is an non-fungible token (NFT) ecosystem for culture and creativity, built with Ethereum.

## What's Palm?

Palm network is an Ethereum sidechain dedicated to selling, purchasing, and trading NFTs that are
associated with real-world and digital assets.

Palm uses IBFT 2.0 proof of authority (PoA) consensus, with network validators being run
by partners and key stakeholders. IBFT 2.0 is over 99% more energy efficient than proof of work
(PoW) networks.  Palm will continue to onboard new validators and progressively increase
decentralization over time.

A bridge relay service connects payment tokens and NFTs on Ethereum and the Palm network, with
bridging contracts deployed on both networks to manage the connection.

## Why develop on Palm?

Powered by the $Palm token, the ecosystem empowers creators and artists to mint energy-efficient
NFTs with low gas fees and fast transaction finality.

Palm is a fully Ethereum-compatible network, allowing you to deploy any EVM-compatible smart
contracts and use standard, familiar [Ethereum tools] during application development.

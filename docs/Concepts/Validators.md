# Validators

In IBFT 2.0  Proof-of-Authority (PoA) networks such as Palm, validators are nodes that validate
transactions and blocks. Validators take turns to create the next block. Before inserting the block
onto the chain, a super-majority (greater than 66%) of validators must first sign the block.

Validators earn rewards for keeping the network honest. Validator nodes will initially be run by key
stakeholders and technical partners.

[Contact us] if you need assistance setting up a validator, or reach out on [Discord].

Use a [transaction node] or the [Infura endpoints] to read transaction history or send transactions
on the Palm network without performing validator duties.

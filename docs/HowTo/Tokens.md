# Get PALM tokens

The PALM token is the native token for the ecosystem and is required to cover transaction costs
on the network.

Users can request PALM by completing the form for the respective environments:

* [Development and testing](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetkTsotYiiGdMjNkJEUgUyRlWliIQ7O8YGHbrzJyfnCYnBfA/viewform)
* [Production](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5LcKvAvZE0MllXlrdU0Whveq1GLBePEbh6yYaABaVSDfRyw/viewform)

Palm partners have access to [faucet APIs] to load or top up accounts with PALM.
Partners can use the faucet on various Palm environment networks (Production, Development, Testing).

    Access to the faucet APIs is restricted to partners by using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

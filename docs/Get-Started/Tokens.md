# Get PALM tokens

The PALM token is the native token for the ecosystem and is required to cover transaction costs
on the network.

## Use the request form

Users can request PALM by completing the form for the respective environments:

* [Palm Testnet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetkTsotYiiGdMjNkJEUgUyRlWliIQ7O8YGHbrzJyfnCYnBfA/viewform)
* [Palm Mainnet](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5LcKvAvZE0MllXlrdU0Whveq1GLBePEbh6yYaABaVSDfRyw/viewform)

## Use the bridge

The Palm bridge can be used to transfer tokens between the Palm network and Ethereum.
When assets are transferred from Ethereum to Palm, the bridge will top up the depositor's account with a small amount of PALM.

Palm provides the following environment-specific bridges:

* [Testnet bridge](https://app.palm-uat.xyz/bridge).
  See [how to use the testnet bridge](../HowTo/Bridge.md#using-the-testnet-bridge).
* [Mainnet bridge](https://app.palm.io/bridge).
  See [how to use the Mainnet bridge](../HowTo/Bridge.md#using-the-mainnet-bridge).

## Use the faucet

Palm partners have access to faucet APIs to top up accounts with PALM.  These faucets are available
across Palm network environments (Production, Development, Testing).  For more information on
getting access to these faucet APIs, please [contact us].

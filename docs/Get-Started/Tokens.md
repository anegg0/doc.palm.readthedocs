# Get PALM tokens

The PALM token is the native token for the ecosystem and is required to cover transaction costs
on the network.

## Use the request form

Users can request PALM by completing the form for the respective environments:

* [Development and testing](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSetkTsotYiiGdMjNkJEUgUyRlWliIQ7O8YGHbrzJyfnCYnBfA/viewform)
* [Production](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5LcKvAvZE0MllXlrdU0Whveq1GLBePEbh6yYaABaVSDfRyw/viewform)

## Use the bridge

The Palm bridge can be used to transfer tokens between the Palm network and Ethereum. Palm provides
the following bridges which connect the Palm development and testing environments to the
Ethereum Rinkeby testnet:

* [Development environment bridge](https://app.palm-dev.xyz/)
* [Testing environment bridge](https://app.palm-uat.xyz/).

## Use the faucet

Palm partners have access to faucet APIs to top up accounts with PALM.  These faucets are available
across Palm network environments (Production, Development, Testing).  For more information on
getting access to these faucet APIs, please [contact us].

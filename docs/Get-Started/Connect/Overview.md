# Connect to the Palm network

Use [Infura](https://infura.io/) to connect to the Palm network.
Infura is a blockchain development suite that provides access to the Ethereum network over HTTPS and WebSockets.
Although the Palm network is a separate network from Ethereum, your Infura account and project information is used to
authenticate you on the Palm network.

You can also [run a transaction node] if you don't want to use the Infura endpoints.

The instructions in this section allow you to connect to the target Palm network environment.
You can connect to:

- [The Palm testnet](Testnet.md): Palm's testing environment.
  This is useful as a staging environment and for long-term testing.
  You can use [the Palm Testnet bridge](../../HowTo/Bridge.md#using-the-palm-testnet-bridge) to transfer assets between
  Palm Testnet and the Ethereum Rinkeby testnet.
- [Palm Mainnet](Mainnet.md): Palm's production environment.
  Contracts and accounts in this network hold real value.
  You can use [the Palm Mainnet bridge](../../HowTo/Bridge.md#using-the-palm-mainnet-bridge) to transfer assets between
  Palm Mainnet and Ethereum Mainnet.
